# Registration-Form-Tutorial-PHP-mySQL

I copied the index.html, connect.php, and bootstrap from a github account.  I installed Apache24, mySQL, and PHP.  Through a lot of troubleshooting, I was able to connect php to localhost, then connect to myPHPAdmin to then eventually create a database with its table that syncs with connect.php.
I also decided to create an env file for the first time and create a gitignore file.  I decided to use [echo ".env" >> .gitignore] in the git bash terminal to add env into gitignore.  Unfortunately, after a lot of troubleshooting I learned that since Github is a static website that it can't run PHP content.
I don't know if theres another way to run the HTML file besides accessing the repo folder, then running the PHP built-in server in the localhost:8000 and maybe make the Form(html) accessbile for public use.
